## üìò Introduction
It didn‚Äôt start with a flashing warning or a big breach. It started with something small ‚Äî small enough to ignore.  

Fresh off a factory reset, the VivoBook demanded the BitLocker recovery key. Instead of the normal sign-in flow, Windows flagged the personal account as a ‚Äúwork email.‚Äù Off at first glance, but not urgent.  

That changed quickly. Unexpected prompts, settings shifting on their own, and subtle changes began to stack up. Within weeks, the same disturbances showed up across other devices.  

No help came ‚Äî not from professionals, not from the inner circle. The problem was too strange, too invisible for anyone else to believe. Clean installs, factory resets, and config changes failed. Repair attempts gave way to a new approach: documentation.  

This repository is the result of months of investigation, built in real time, on compromised hardware, without a safety net. Not a clean lab. Not a theory exercise. Every entry is drawn from direct, repeatable experience.  

One small event was all it took. From there, the unraveling gathered its own momentum.  

Designed for clarity, reproducibility, and empowerment ‚Äî not for academic polish or institutional approval. Every byte recorded here is observed, not assumed.

## üß≠ Methodology
This work is guided by six vectors: **Work Profile, Data Exfiltration, Telephony, Overlay & UI, Test & Debug, Persistence.** Every app and system process is mapped against these vectors at the forensic level.  

The approach combines:  
- Community knowledge (Google, Reddit, XDA) ‚Äî real-world cases and shared exploits.  
- App tooling ‚Äî Inure, App Manager, Fing, NetGuard, RethinkDNS, APK Mirror.  
- Direct observation ‚Äî logging device activity, overlays, telephony, and persistence testing.

## üìÖ Timeline of Events

**January 2025**  
Initial signs appear after a factory reset on the Asus VivoBook. Attempting to retrieve the BitLocker key triggers a ‚Äúwork email‚Äù login prompt on a personal account ‚Äî later tied to unauthorized MDM enrollment. Early system shifts surface.  

**February 2025**  
Laptop anomalies persist. Forced updates, network instability, and permission resets continue. Suspicion builds, but the full scope isn‚Äôt yet connected across devices.  

**March 2025**  
Escalation. Physical theft coincides with forced resets, unauthorized changes, and confirmed SIM manipulation. Three devices compromised: Asus VivoBook, OnePlus 6T, BLU V.  

**April 2025**  
Two new devices join: TCL K24 and Celeron 5. TCL K24 shows abnormal behavior within minutes of Wi-Fi login. Celeron 5, with no old accounts, still shows early compromise indicators.  

**May 2025**  
A new iPhone X shows anomalies within 24 hours of Wi-Fi use, followed by SIM swap via eSIM. Around the same time, unsolicited parental control prompts hit the smart TV. By month‚Äôs end: six devices compromised.  

**June 2025**  
Research points to router-level interference and MITM-like behavior. Smart TVs show MDM-style controls: blocked stores, lost remotes, irregular MAC addresses.  

**July 2025**  
Mobile app login redirects to an ISP error page. Inspection reveals malformed URL syntax using non-standard slashes ‚Äî first confirmed case of URL manipulation via glyph drift.  

**August 2025**  
A new router shows DNS traffic rerouted despite Cloudflare settings. A new iPhone stays boxed and offline. Attempts to explain the scope to family end in disbelief. Documentation continues.  

**üìå Current Status (August 2025)**  
All compromised vectors are mapped with precision. Zero tolerance for fluff.  

**Total Compromised Devices: 9**

## üîí Goal
To give clarity and structure for anyone feeling lost, scared, or gaslit ‚Äî by devices or by people around them. The weight of this experience is hard to grasp unless you‚Äôve lived it.  

This guide is here to remind you: **you are not alone.**
